_I created a website where users can browse and adopt various pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds. This platform offers a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience for pet lovers looking to find their perfect companion._

## 📝 Short Description of the Project
This website allows users to browse pets by categories like dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds. It offers key interactive features such as liking pets, adopting them, and viewing detailed information about each pet in a user-friendly manner.

## 🌟 5 Key Features of the Project
- **Category-wise Navigation**: The website offers four category buttons for cats, dogs, rabbits, and birds. Users can click on their preferred category to load the pets, with a 2-second delay for a smooth transition. If no pets are available, a "No information available" message is shown.
- **Pet Cards**: Each pet is displayed within a bordered card, which includes three interactive buttons for different actions.
- **Thumbs Up Feature**: Clicking the thumbs-up button adds the pet's thumbnail to the right side of the screen for easy reference.
- **Adopt Feature**: When users click the "Adopt" button, a modal appears for 3 seconds. After the modal closes, the button changes to "Adopted" and becomes disabled.
- **Details Modal**: Clicking the "Details" button opens a modal displaying additional information about the pet.

## 📚 ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Used for a shorter and more concise way to write functions, making the code cleaner and easier to read.
- **Template Literals**: Employed to easily construct dynamic strings, especially when including variables or expressions within the string, improving readability and flexibility.
- **Async/Await**: Utilized to handle asynchronous operations (such as fetching data from an API) in a more straightforward and readable way than traditional promises.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Applied to extract values from objects or arrays into individual variables, simplifying access to object properties.
- **Sort by Price Button**: A Sort By Price button is available to help users sort pets in descending order based on their price.When clicked, the displayed pet cards are dynamically rearranged to show the highest-priced pets first.This feature ensures users can quickly browse through the best deals by sorting pets with just a single click.
